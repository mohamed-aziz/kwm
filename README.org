  kwm (Knani's Window Manager) is an Emacs-like window manager. It's a fork of dwm.
  
** Why another window manager
   Because for me stumpWM is too much and ratpoison's code is clusterfuck.
   
   That's why we need a [[https://suckless.org/][suckless]] window manager.
   
   This doesn't have any useless feature, because efficient Emacs users only run Emacs (and a web browser).

   **Note: this is not affiliated in any way with suckless it just adheres to the philosophy**

** Work to be done

   - [ ] Add ability to do splits
   - [ ] Add ability to select windows using dmenu
   - [ ] Add a stack for history
 
** How does it look like?
   
   It's a window manager it doesn't look like anything. If you insist here is a scrot (not like the ones you see on r/unixporn )

** How to use this?


   I offer no binaries but installing shouldn't be very hard on Linux

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cd
     git clone https://github.com/mohame-aziz/kwm.git
     cd kwm
     make
     echo "exec $HOME/kwm/kwm" >> .xinitrc

     startx
   #+END_SRC
   
   Read the config file to know the keybindings but most the time I just clone stumpWM.

** There is a bug
   
   Open an issue in the bug tracker or email me and it will get fixed.

** I want feature X
   
   I probably have no use for it so do it yourself.
