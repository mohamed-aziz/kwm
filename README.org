  kwm (Knani's Window Manager) is an Emacs-like window manager.
  
  It's a fork of dwm.

** Why another window manager
   Because stumpwm is too much and ratpoison is clusterfuck.

   That's why we need a [[https://suckless.org/][suckless]] window manager.

   This doesn't have any "virtual desktops", groups, tags or any useless feature because Emacs users run most of the time Emacs and a browser (and sometimes a terminal emulator).
   
** Work to be done

   - [ ] Add ability to do splits
     - [ ] Add borders
   - [ ] Add ability to select windows

** There is a bug
   
   Open an issue in the bug tracker or email me and it will get fixed.

** I want feature X
   
   I probably have no use for it so do it yourself.
