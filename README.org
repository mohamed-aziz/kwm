* kwm

  kwm (Knani's Window Manager) is an Emacs-like window manager.
  
  It's a fork of dwm.

** Why another window manager
   Because stumpwm is too much[fn:1] and ratpoison is clusterfuck[fn:2].
   
   That's why we need a [[https://suckless.org/][suckless]] window manager.

   
   This doesn't have any useless feature, because efficient Emacs users only run Emacs (and a web browsers).

** Work to be done

   - [ ] Add ability to do splits
     - [ ] Add borders
   - [ ] Add ability to select windows

** There is a bug
   
   Open an issue in the bug tracker or email me and it will get fixed.

** I want feature X
   
   I probably have no use for it so do it yourself.

** How to write features
   
   After writing the feature use the =startxephyr.sh= script or run kwm from another tty.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     startx /home/mo/code/kwm2/kwm 2>&1 > log.log && cat log.log
   #+END_SRC

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Loading a whole Common Lisp system can be useful for big programs, this offers the ability to alter them in run time, I can't find how this is useful for a window manager.

[fn:2] Look at the ratpoison source code it's clusterfuck and it's pretty much abandon-ware there is only one guy from France pusing code to it.
